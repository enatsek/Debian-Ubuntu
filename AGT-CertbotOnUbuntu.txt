#---1. Preliminary Tasks
# 1.1. Snap Daemon
# Certbot is installed as a snap, Ubuntu 22.04 installs snap daemon (snapd) 
#   by default. If in any case it is not installed, you can install snapd by 
#   the following command:
sudo apt install snapd
# 1.2. Remove Old Certbot Packages (If any)
# If you've installed certbot's apt package before, remove it:
sudo apt remove certbot


#---2. Installation and Getting SSL Certificate
# 2.1. Ensure that your snapd (snap deamon) is up to date:
sudo snap install core; sudo snap refresh core
#
# 2.2. Install Certbot
sudo snap install --classic certbot
#
# 2.3. Get SSL Certificate
sudo certbot --apache
# Asks your email, don't hesitate giving it, you will be informed if any problems
#   occurs at the renewal of certificates.
#
# 2.4. Test automatic renewal
sudo certbot renew --dry-run
#
# 2.5. All set, certificates generated and installed, all apache
#   configurations are made, jobs added to crontab to renew certs.
#   Check crontab:
systemctl list-timers


#---3. Certbot Renewal Hooks
# When your free certificate is automatically renewed, apache needs to be 
#   restarted. Any other software using your certificate needs to be reloaded
#   also (like postfix and dovecot). 
# Certbot runs all scripts in the  /etc/letsencrypt/renewal-hooks/deploy
#   directory after a successfull renewal. We'll put there a scipt.
sudo nano /etc/letsencrypt/renewal-hooks/deploy/reloadall.sh
#__________________________________________
#!/bin/bash
systemctl reload apache2
systemctl reload postfix
systemctl reload dovecot
#__________________________________________
# Make the script executable
sudo chmod +x /etc/letsencrypt/renewal-hooks/deploy/reloadall.sh
