</a> <div id="Div2" style="margin-left:10%;"><pre><code># 2 Ubuntu 22.04 Servers with IPs 192.168.0.231 and 192.168.0.232
#   Everything works with 20.04 version too
# Floating IP Address: 192.168.0.230
# Floating IP address will point to first server; if first server goes off
#   for any reason, then floating IP address will point to second server. 
#   It will return to the first server again when it goes back online.
# This looks like clustering only at the network level.
# All the necessary services on the first server must be installed on second
#   server too. (Web server, DB server, mail server etc)
# The servers must be in the same network.
#
# Based on the book Mastering Ubuntu Server 2nd Ed. by Jay LaCroix
#   This book has introduced me to Ubuntu Server and I have to thank him for this
#   excellent book:

#
# You may establish a full cluster of LAMP stack by:
#   1. Installing Apache on both servers
#   2. Configuring the apache and sites equally on the both server
#   3. Installing MariaDB on both server
#   4. Establishing Master-Master Replication for Mariadb on 1st and 2nd servers
