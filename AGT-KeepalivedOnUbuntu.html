<p> <H4><a href="javascript:myFunction('Div2')">Specs
</a> </H4><div id="Div2" style="margin-left:1%;"><pre ># - 2 Ubuntu 22.04 LTS Servers with IPs 192.168.0.231 and 192.168.0.232
# - Everything works with 20.04 version too
# - Floating IP Address: 192.168.0.230
# - Floating IP address will point to first server; if first server goes off
# for any reason, then floating IP address will point to second server. It will 
# return to the first server again when it goes back online.
# - This looks like clustering only at the network level.
# - All the necessary services on the first server must be installed on second
# server too. (Web server, DB server, mail server etc)
# The servers must be in the same network.
#
# - Based on the book Mastering Ubuntu Server 2nd Ed. by Jay LaCroix. This book has
# introduced me to Ubuntu Server and I have to thank him for this excellent book:
<a href="https://www.packtpub.com/networking-and-servers/mastering-ubuntu-server-second-edition" target="_blank">https://www.packtpub.com/networking-and-servers/mastering-ubuntu-server-second-edition</a>
#
# - You may establish a full cluster of LAMP stack by:
# 1. Installing Apache on both servers
# 2. Configuring the apache and sites equally on the both server
# 3. Installing MariaDB on both server
# 4. Establishing Master-Master Replication for Mariadb on 1st and 2nd servers
