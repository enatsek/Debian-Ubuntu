#---Specs
# 2 Ubuntu 22.04 Servers with IPs 192.168.0.231 and 192.168.0.232
#   Everything works with 20.04 version too
# Floating IP Address: 192.168.0.230
# Floating IP address will point to first server; if first server goes off
#   for any reason, then floating IP address will point to second server. 
#   It will return to the first server again when it goes back online.
# This looks like clustering only at the network level.
# All the necessary services on the first server must be installed on second
#   server too. (Web server, DB server, mail server etc)
# The servers must be in the same network.
#
# Based on the book Mastering Ubuntu Server 2nd Ed. by Jay LaCroix
#   This book has introduced me to Ubuntu Server and I have to thank him for this
#   excellent book:

#
# You may establish a full cluster of LAMP stack by:
#   1. Installing Apache on both servers
#   2. Configuring the apache and sites equally on the both server
#   3. Installing MariaDB on both server
#   4. Establishing Master-Master Replication for Mariadb on 1st and 2nd servers
#


#---1. Install keepalived
# install on both the first and the second servers
sudo apt install keepalived
#  after installation, tries to start but cannot because there is no config

#---2. First Server Config
# Config file location is /etc/keepalived directory, initially empty
# Create primary server conf file
sudo nano /etc/keepalived/keepalived.conf
#  primary config file contents

# explanations
#   global_defs
#       notification_email
#           email address to notify of cluster changes
#           replace notify@x11.xyz with your email
#	notification_email_from keepalived@x11.xyz
#           from address on the email, change as you wish
#       smtp_server
#           smtp server to send the mail through
#       smtp_connect_timeout
#           30 seconds would be enough
#       router_id
#           Any value to distinguish
#   vrrp_instance
#	interface xxxxx
#		network interface to run keepalived
#	virtual_router_id xx
#		keepalived clusterid (0-255)
#		must be same on all cluster members
#	priority xx
#		must be different on each cluster member
#		highest will be master member of the cluster
#	virtual_ip_address
#		floating ip address of the cluster
#


#---3. Second Server Config
# Almost the same as step 2. Just give a smaller number (say 90) for priority.
# If you want to add more servers, give them numbers less then 90

#---4. Start keepalived
# run on both servers
sudo systemctl start keepalived
#   You can check the status of you cluster
sudo systemctl status -l keepalived
