# 3 servers will be installed and configured as Mariadb clusters. All the 
#   changes in one server will be updated to others momentarily.
# At least 3 nodes are advised for Mariadb cluster, there is no upper limit.
# 
# !!! At least 2 of the cluster nodes must be online always. If you fall to 1
#   you may have problems. If you shut down all of the nodes, your cluster stops
#   and you need some work to (hopefully) start again. !!!

<p> <a href="javascript:myFunction('Div7')">5. Maintenance 
</a> <div id="Div7" style="margin-left:10%;"><pre><code># 5.1. Healthcheck
# The following commands runs on Mariadb shell and show information about
#   Mariadb cluster.
# Show the running nodes:
show status like 'wsrep_incoming_addresses' ;
# Show the number of running nodes:
show status like 'wsrep_cluster_size';
# Show the UUID of the cluster
show status like 'wsrep_cluster_state_uuid';
# Show the status of the current node
show status like 'wsrep_local_state_comment';
#
# 5.2. Adding a Node to Mariadb Cluster
# Install Mariadb and Galera Cluster to the new node, that is follow the steps at
#   1. and 2. At step 2.3. at the line starting with wsrep_cluster_address, add the 
#   IP of the new server too. Then start mariadb:
sudo systemctl start mariadb
# The new node is going to start replicating data, it may take some time depending
#   on the volume of the DBs. You can run following command and see the status of
#   the replication:
show status like 'wsrep_local_state_comment';
# When you see the value as "Synced", you can understand that the new node is 
#   replicated.
# You added the ip of the new node to the configuration of the new node only. Before,
#   it is too late, You need to add it to the other cluster member configuraitons too.
#   Otherwise, it would be very difficult to resolve if any cluster error occurs in 
#   the future.exi
# Run on other cluster members one by one:
sudo nano /etc/mysql/mariadb.conf.d/99-cluster.cnf
# At the line starting with wsrep_cluster_address, add the IP of the new server.
# Restart Mariadb after changing the configuration
sudo systemctl restart mariadb
# 
# 5.3. Removing a Node from Mariadb Cluster
# If you want to remove a node temporarily, it wouldn't be a problem. If you don't 
#   change any configurations on the cluster servers, it would join back to the 
#   cluster.
# If you want to remove a node permanently, a good way would be uninstall mariadb or
#   permanently poweroff the computer. And then, remove its ip from other servers'
#   /etc/mysql/mariadb.conf.d/99-cluster.cnf file and restart mariadb at the other
#   servers one by one.
#
# 5.4. Shutting Down the Cluster
# It is not advised to keep less than 2 nodes online. But if you really need to 
#   shutdown all the cluster (e.g. to physically move to somewhere else), or a 
#   total power failure occurs; you may try to shutdown server one at a time and 
#   when they are ready to start, first you have to turn on the last shutdowned node.
#   If the cluster doesn't go online, refer to 6.

<p> <a href="javascript:myFunction('Div8')">6. Recovery
</a> <div id="Div8" style="margin-left:10%;"><pre><code># Mariadb Galera Cluster would run fine for a long time, as long as you keep at 
#   least 2 nodes alive and running. If you have 3 nodes, you can proceed on  
#   maintenance tasks (backup, upgrade etc) one at a time. 
# But problems are for humans (and computers). There might come one day and
#   cluster doesn't start. And when cluster doesn't start, Mariadb doesn't start
#   either.
# In that case, we need to restart the cluster, but we need to find the safe
#   node to start the cluster.
#
# 6.1. Finding the Safe Node - 1st Try
#   run the following command on every node:
sudo cat /var/lib/mysql/grastate.dat
# It's output will be something like below:
#_______________________________________________________
# GALERA saved state
version: 2.1
uuid:    2d878884-9ae6-11eb-955f-fa6fa258f122
seqno:   -1
safe_to_bootstrap: 0
#_______________________________________________________
# or
#_______________________________________________________
# GALERA saved state
version: 2.1
uuid: 886dd8da-3d07-11e8-a109-8a3c80cebab4
seqno: 31929
safe_to_bootstrap: 1
#_______________________________________________________
#
# If output in any node contains "safe_to_bootstrap: 1" or a positive value of 
#   "seqno: ", that means we can restart the cluster at that node. We have found
#   the safe node, proceed to 6.3.
# Otherwise, we keep trying to find the safe node.
#
# 6.2. Finding the Safe Node - 2nd Try
# !!! Run on all nodes !!!
sudo galera_recovery
# Output will be something like as below:
#___________________________________________________
WSREP: Recovered position 2d878884-9ae6-11eb-955f-fa6fa258f122:8
--wsrep_start_position=2d878884-9ae6-11eb-955f-fa6fa258f122:8
#___________________________________________________
#
# The node with the highest value after ":" will be our candidate to restart the
#   cluster. We have found the safe node. If more than 1 node has the same highest 
#   value, just choose one.
# We need to set safe node to restart the cluster:
# !!! Run on the Safe Node !!!
sudo nano /var/lib/mysql/grastate.dat
# Change the line starting with "safe_to_bootstrap" as below:
#________________________________
safe_to_bootstrap: 1
#________________________________
#
# 6.3. Restart the Galera Cluster
# Run the following command at the safe node:
sudo galera_new_cluster
# After a while (1-2minutes) Run following command at the other nodes:
sudo systemctl restart mariadb
# The cluster is working again, we are done
# It would be wise to make a healthcheck as in 5.1. and see cluster is working.
#
# If this step doesn't work either. We have just one more thing to do. Go to the 
#    next step.
#
# 
# 6.4. Last Chance
# !! On the safe node !!
# Disable mariadb and reboot
sudo systemctl disable mariadb
sudo reboot
#
# Edit cluster config at the safe node:
sudo nano /etc/mysql/mariadb.conf.d/99-cluster.cnf
# Change the wsrep_cluster_address parameter to contain only the safe node
#    e.g. if the 3rd node is the safe node as below
wsrep_cluster_address = "gcomm://192.168.0.233"
# Enable mariadb 
sudo systemctl enable mariadb
# Start Galera Cluster
sudo galera_new_cluster
#
# !! On the other nodes !!
# Restart mariadb 
sudo systemctl restart mariadb
# If they cannot restart, it is because it cannot be stopped
#   Do the disable, reboot, enable trick on them too
sudo systemctl disable mariadb
sudo reboot
# After reboot enable and start mariadb
sudo systemctl enable mariadb
sudo systemctl start mariadb
# If they start, most probably your cluster is working again
#    Otherwise, you need professional support
# 
# !! On the safe node
# Revert the first node to the original configuration
sudo nano /etc/mysql/mariadb.conf.d/99-cluster.cnf
# Change the wsrep_cluster_address parameter to original
wsrep_cluster_address = "gcomm://192.168.0.231,192.168.0.232,192.168.0.233"
# Restart mariadb
sudo systemctl restart mariadb
