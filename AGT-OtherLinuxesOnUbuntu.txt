# 0.1. Information
# This site is for Ubuntu Linux and Python programming language. 
# Time to time, an Ubuntu admin may need to admin other Linuxes too. In this
#   tutorial, my aim is to help with other linuxes, namely Debian, Red Hat,
#   Opensuse, and Alpine.
# Main subjects are:
#   - Package Management
#   - Network Configuration
#   - Installing LAMP Stack
# Main Distributions:
#   - Debian 11.x, 10.x, 9.x
#   - RHEL (Centos, Alma, Rocky) 9.x, 8.x
#   - OpenSuse Leap 15.x
#   - Alpine 3.17

#--- 1. Debian Versions: 11.x, 10.x, 9.x
# As Ubuntu being a derivative of Debian, nearly all of the commands of Debian 
#    are the same as Ubuntu's. The only exception is network configuration. Ubuntu
#    uses netplan, Debian does not.
#
# 1.1. Package Management
# Commands require root or sudo.
# 1.1.1. Update Cache
apt update
# 1.1.2. Upgrade Packages
apt upgrade
# 1.1.3. Install a Package
apt install apache2
# 1.1.4. Remove a Package
apt remove apache2
# 1.1.5. Search a Package
apt search apache2
# 1.1.6. Clean Unused Packages
apt autoremove
# 
# 1.2. Network Configuration
# 1.2.1. Get the name of the network adapter
# The name of the network adapter will be something like enp0s3, but we need the 
#    exact name. 
# The following command lists the network interface name(s). The one in en* format
#    should be the name of your network adapter.
ls /sys/class/net
# In any case you cannot get the name, you can try to following command:
ip a
#
# 1.2.2. IP configuration. 
sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces
# I assume that your network adapter name is enp0s3, otherwise change it.
# Fill the file like below (change to your IP addresses)
#_________________________________________
auto enp0s3
iface enp0s3 inet static
address 192.168.0.3/24
broadcast 192.168.0.255
network 192.168.0.0
gateway 192.168.0.1
#_________________________________________
# If you want to use DHCP, fill the file as below
#_________________________________________
auto enp0s3
iface enp0s3 inet dhcp
#_________________________________________
# 
# 1.2.3. DNS Addresses
sudo nano /etc/resolv.conf
# Add your DNS addresses as below
#_____________________________________
nameserver 46.196.235.35
nameserver 178.233.140.110
nameserver 46.197.15.60
#_____________________________________
#
# 1.2.4. Restart Network Adapter
# Assuming your network adapter name is enp0s3
sudo ifdown enp0s3 && sudo ifup enp0s3
# If you are connecting through SSH, your connection would break up. You need 
#    to connect with the new IP again.
#
# 1.3. Installing LAMP Stack
# It is exactly the same as in Ubuntu server.
# 1.3.1. Install packages
sudo apt update
sudo apt install --yes apache2 mariadb-server php libapache2-mod-php php-mysql
# This is all we need actually. But if you are like me, that is you have to see
#    it to believe it; you are going to want to test it. So let's test it.
#
# 1.3.2. Test LAMP
# We'll create a test database on Mariadb, we'll create a table in that database,
#    add some rows to the table. We will also create a test PHP file with the 
#    PHP code to retrieve the data from the database and display it as HTML. 
#    That way we'll be able to test the PHP-Mariadb and PHP-Apache connections.
sudo mariadb
# Create nysampledb database, connect to it, create a table, fill the table,
#    create a user with the access permission to that database and the table.
# !!! BEGIN Run on Mariadb shell. !!!
CREATE DATABASE mysampledb;
USE mysampledb;
CREATE TABLE Employees (Name char(15), Age int(3), Occupation char(15));
INSERT INTO Employees VALUES ('Joe Smith', '26', 'Ninja');
INSERT INTO Employees VALUES ('John Doe', '33', 'Sleeper');
INSERT INTO Employees VALUES ('Mariadb Server', '14', 'RDBM');
GRANT ALL ON mysampledb.* TO 'appuser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
exit
# !!! END Run on Mariadb shell. !!!
# 
# Create test PHP
sudo nano /var/www/html/test.php
# Fill it as below
#_________________________________________________________________________
<?php
   $mycon = new mysqli("localhost", "appuser", "password", "mysampledb");
   if ($mycon->connect_errno)
   {
      echo "Connection Error";
      exit();
   }
   $mysql = "SELECT * FROM Employees";
   $result = ($mycon->query($mysql));
   $rows = [];
   if ($result->num_rows > 0)
    {
        $rows = $result->fetch_all(MYSQLI_ASSOC);
    }
?>
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Name</th>
                <th>Age</th>
                <th>Occupation</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <?php
               if(!empty($rows))
               foreach($rows as $row)
              {
            ?>
            <tr>
                <td><?php echo $row['Name']; ?></td>
                <td><?php echo $row['Age']; ?></td>
                <td><?php echo $row['Occupation']; ?></td>
            </tr>
            <?php } ?>
        </tbody>
    </table>
</body>
</html>
<?php
    mysqli_close($conn);
?>
#_________________________________________________________________________
#
# Now, from your workstation's browser, load the page (replace srv with your 
#    server's IP: 
#    http:/srv/test.php
# You can use the same steps for testing LAMP stack on other distros too.


#--- 2. RHEL (Centos, Alma, Rocky) Versions: 9.x, 8.x
# Centos (upto 8.x version), Alma and Rocky Linux are bug-for-bug compatible with
#    Red Hat. That is, they are same other than brandings and names. So if
#    something works in RHEL, it works in Centos, Alma, and Rocky too.
# RHEL gives free licenses for testing purposes, I have 2 VMs running for
#    testing purposes (versions 8.x and 9.x).
# 2.1. Package Management
# Commands require root or sudo.
# 2.1.1. Update Cache
# Not available and not necessary (as much as i know).
# 2.1.2. Upgrade Packages
dnf upgrade
# 2.1.3. Install a Package
dnf install httd
# 2.1.4. Remove a Package
dnf remove httpd
# 2.1.5. Search a Package
dnf search httpd
# 2.1.6. Clean Unused Packages
dnf autoremove
# 
# 2.2. Network Configuration
# 2.2.1. Get the name of the network adapter
# The name of the network adapter will be something like enp0s3, but we need the 
#    exact name. 
# The following command lists the network interface name(s). The one in en* format
#    should be the name of your network adapter.
ls /sys/class/net
# In any case you cannot get the name, you can try to following command:
ip a
#
# 2.2.2. IP and DNS configuration. 
# I assume that your network adapter name is enp0s3, otherwise change it.
# Change IP and Gateway, change DNS
sudo nmcli con modify 'enp0s3' ifname enp0s3 ipv4.method manual \
   ipv4.addresses 192.168.0.210/24 gw4 192.168.0.1
sudo nmcli con modify 'enp0s3' ipv4.dns 8.8.8.8
#
# 2.2.3. Restart Network Adapter
sudo nmcli con down 'enp0s3' && sudo nmcli con up 'enp0s3'
#
# 2.3. Installing LAMP Stack
# As you might expect package names are different in RHEL (e.g. httpd instead of
#    apache2).
# 2.3.1. Install packages
sudo dnf -y install httpd mariadb-server php php-mysqlnd
#
# 2.3.2. Enable and Start Apache and Mariadb
sudo systemctl enable --now httpd
sudo systemctl start httpd
sudo systemctl enable --now mariadb
sudo systemctl start mariadb
#
# 2.3.3. Opening Firewall Ports
# RHEL activates firewall by default. We have to open http and https ports
#    permanently.
sudo firewall-cmd --add-service=http --add-service=https
sudo firewall-cmd --add-service=http --add-service=https --permanent
#
# 2.3.4. Test
# You can use the test scenario at 1.3.2 to test RHEL LAMP stack. For RHEL 8, you 
#    should run "sudo mysql" instead of "sudo mariadb".


#--- 3. OpenSuse Leap Version 15.x
# As far as I know, OpenSuse Leap is binary compatible with Suse Linux. So 
#    anything works in OpenSuse, must work in Suse too.
# 3.1. Package Management
# Commands require root or sudo.
# 3.1.1. Update Cache
zypper refresh
# 3.1.2. Upgrade Packages

# 3.1.6. Clean Unused Packages
# Not available as much as I know.
# 
# 3.2. Network Configuration
# OpenSuse has a configuration utility, you can configure a lot of thing including
#    the network. Usage is easy and intuitive:
sudo yast
# But we will also handle the classical way.
#
# 3.2.1. Get the name of the network adapter
# The name of the network adapter will be something like eth0 or eth1, but we need 
#    the exact name. 
# The following command lists the network interface name(s). The one in eth* format
#    should be the name of your network adapter.
ls /sys/class/net
# In any case you cannot get the name, you can try to following command:
ip a
#
# 3.2.2. IP and DNS configuration. 
# I assume that your network adapter name is eth0, otherwise change it. 
# Change IP address:
sudo nano /etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-eth0
# File contents will be like below
#_____________________________________________
BOOTPROTO='static'
STARTMODE='auto'
IPADDR='192.168.0.248'
NETMASK='255.255.255.0'
#_____________________________________________

# 3.3.2. Enable and Start Apache and Mariadb
sudo systemctl enable apache2
sudo systemctl start apache2
sudo systemctl enable mariadb
sudo systemctl start mariadb
#
# 3.3.3. Test
# You can use the test scenario at 1.3.2 to test OpenSuse LAMP stack. Just 
#    remember, default web site directory is /srv/www/htdocs/ in OpenSuse.
