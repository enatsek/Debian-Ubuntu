#---Specs
# PHPMyAdmin is a powerful web based management tool for Mysql and Mariadb
# You have to install it on the server which has the DB installed
# It is installed as an Apache conf and after installing, you can reach PHPMyAdmin
#   with /phpmyadmin directory through all the apache sites on the server
# On my config I wanted to bind PHPMyAdmin to only one site config on the server side
#   and restrict it with only 1 client IP (might be more) to reach.
#
# My Hostname: test.karasite.com
# Lamp is already installed (See LampOnUbuntu Tutorial)
# My Client IP address: 35.209.74.9

#---1. Revert mariadb root to unix_socket
#   On LAMP installation, we changed the MariaDB root user plugin to mysql native.
#   Unfortunately PHPMyAdmin gives an error on installation with this setting.
#   So we'll revert it back to unix socket momentarily
mariadb -u root -p
#   On MariaDB shell:
UPDATE mysql.user SET plugin = 'unix_socket' WHERE USER='root';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
exit;

#---2. Install and configure phpmyadmin
sudo apt install phpmyadmin 
# First Screen: Make sure apache2 is selected, there must be an * on its box
#    (press space to select, tab to go OK, press enter) 
# Second screen: Select Yes and give a good password for phpmyadmin user

#---3. Convert mariadb root to native again
#  We will restore Maria root user plugin to mysql native 
sudo mariadb
#   On MariaDB shell:
UPDATE mysql.user SET plugin = 'mysql_native_password' WHERE USER='root';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
exit;

#---4. Disable phpmyadmin apache mod, we'll configure it later in a more secure way
sudo a2disconf phpmyadmin
sudo systemctl reload apache2

#---5. Create test.karasite.com.conf and secure it with SSL
# 5.1. Make a home for the new site
sudo mkdir /var/www/test.karasite.com
# 5.2. Edit phpmyadmin to allow only our IPs
#   Make a backup first (always)
sudo cp /etc/phpmyadmin/apache.conf /etc/phpmyadmin/apache.conf.original
sudo nano /etc/phpmyadmin/apache.conf
#   Just after the line
#      <Directory /usr/share/phpmyadmin>
#      Add your IP as the following format, remember indenting
#      You can add more than 1 IP if required
    Require ip 35.209.74.9
#
# 5.2. Create a site config to reach PHPMyAdmin
#   If you want to use your own conf file, just add the line starting with Include
#      as in the following conf
sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/test.karasite.com.conf
#_________________________________________________________________________
<VirtualHost *:80>
	Include /etc/apache2/conf-available/phpmyadmin.conf
	ServerAdmin webmaster@karasite.com	
	ServerName test.karasite.com
	DocumentRoot /var/www/test.karasite.com
	ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/test.karasite.com-error.log
	CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/test.karasite.com-access.log combined
</VirtualHost>
#_________________________________________________________________________
#
# 5.3. Enable new site
sudo a2en test.karasite.com.conf
# 5.4. Reload Apache
sudo systemctl reload apache2
# 5.5. Enable https for new site, refer CertbotOnUbuntu
# 5.6. To use PHPMyAdmin on SSL site, you need to add a line to the SSL config file
#   created by Certbot, which must be test.karasite.com-le-ssl.conf
sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/test.karasite.com-le-ssl.conf
#   After line <VirtualHost *:443> add the following line: (remember indenting)
	Include /etc/apache2/conf-available/phpmyadmin.conf

#---7. Troubleshooting
# Taken from: DevAnswers:
#    https://devanswers.co/problem-php-7-2-phpmyadmin-warning-in-librariessql-count/
# 7.1. Problem with phpMyAdmin and PHP 7.2: 
#   “Warning in ./libraries/sql.lib.php#613 count(): 
#        Parameter must be an array or an object that implements Countable”
#   This bug is an incompatability issue between PHP7.2 and PHPMyAdmin version in Ubuntu 18.04
#   The easiest solution is to correct the line on sql.lib.php ourselves.
# 7.1.1. Backup sql.lib.php
sudo cp /usr/share/phpmyadmin/libraries/sql.lib.php /usr/share/phpmyadmin/libraries/sql.lib.php.original
# 7.1.2. Modify sql.lib.php
sudo nano /usr/share/phpmyadmin/libraries/sql.lib.php
#   Find: (count($analyzed_sql_results['select_expr'] == 1)
#   Change to:  ((count($analyzed_sql_results['select_expr']) == 1)
#
# 7.2. Problem with phpMyAdmin and PHP 7.2: (at import and export tabs)
#   "Warning in ./libraries/plugin_interface.lib.php#551
#        count(): Parameter must be an array or an object that implements Countable
#   Again, this bug is an incompatability issue between PHP7.2 and PHPMyAdmin version in Ubuntu 18.04
#   The easiest solution is to correct the line on plugin_interface.lib.php ourselves.
# 7.2.1. Backup plugin_interface.lib.php
sudo cp /usr/share/phpmyadmin/libraries/plugin_interface.lib.php /usr/share/phpmyadmin/libraries/plugin_interface.lib.php.original
# 7.2.2. Modify plugin_interface.lib.php
sudo nano /usr/share/phpmyadmin/libraries/plugin_interface.lib.php
#   Find: if (! is_null($options) && count($options) > 0) {
#   If you cannot find it Find: if ($options != null && count($options) > 0) {
#   Change to: if (! is_null($options) && count((array)$options) > 0) {
