# systemd is a suite of basic building blocks for a Linux system. It provides 
#    a system and service manager that runs as PID 1 and starts the rest of the
#    system (from systemd.io site).
# systemd is a software suite that provides an array of system components for
#    Linux operating systems (from wikipedia).
# systemd is an init system for Linux. It replaces SysV init. There are a lot of 
#    distros that use it as an init system, like Debian, Ubuntu, RHEL. Also there
#    are a lot of distros that don't use systemd, like Slackware, Devuan, Alpine, 
#    Gentoo.
# A strong alternative of systemd is OpenRC (you may expect a tutorial for OpenRC).
# 
# 0.1. Definitions
# D-Bus (Desktop Bus) is a message-oriented middleware mechanism that allows
#    communication between multiple processes running concurrently on the same
#    machine (from wikipedia).
# cgroups: A part built into kernel, that allows setting resource utilization
#    limits for processes. Like; cpu shares, memory usage, block I/O per process.
#    Developed by Google. There are Ver1 and Ver2. Ubuntu 22.04 adapted version 2.

<p> <a href="javascript:myFunction('Div3')"> 1. systemd Units
</a> <div id="Div3" style="margin-left:10%;"><pre><code># Units are the resources that systemd knows how to manage and to operate.
# 1.1. Unit Locations
# Locations of unit files (in increasing precedence):
#    /lib/systemd/system
#    /run/systemd/system
#    /etc/systemd/system
#
# 1.2. Unit Types:
# .service: Contains information on managing a service or application. Managing
#    includes starting, stopping, automatic starting, dependencies etc.
# .socket: Describes a socket for systemd's socket based activation. It must have
#    an associated .service file for a service.
# .device: Describes a device that needs systemd management. Not all devices
#    has a .device file.
# .mount: Mountpoints needed to be managed by systemd.
# .automount: Configures a mountpoint to be automatically mounted. Must have a 
#    .mount unit.
# .swap: Describes swap space on the system.
# .target: Used to provide syncronization with other units. 
# .path: Defines a path for path based activation. A matching unit is started 
#    depending on the path existence or inexistence.
# .timer: Defines a timer to be managed by systemd. A matching unit is started 
#    when the timer is reached.
# .snapshot: Created with systemctl snapshot command. Saves a state of the system.
#    Does not survive among sessions.
# .slice: Associated with cgroups (Linux Control Group nodes). Allows resources 
#    to be restricted.
# .scope: Created automatically by systemd from information received from its bus
#    interfaces. Used to manage sets of system processes that are created 
#    externally.

# 1.4. Unit File Structure
# Unit files are made of sections. Unit and Install sections can exist in all
#    types of units. Also there are some other sections which can exist in 
#    certain unit types. They are Socket, Mount, Automount, Swap, Path, Timer,
#    and Slice.
# Sections contain directives. Some directives are unit type specific and some 
#    are general.
# For a full list of directive see:
<a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.directives.html" target="_blank">https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.directives.html</a>
#
# 1.4.1. Unit Section Directives (Applies to all unit types)
# Description: A short description of the unit.
# Documentation: Location of documentation.
# Requires: The units that this unit depends. All of them must be activated for 
#    this unit to be activated.
# Wants: Similar to Requires, but not strict. Systemd tries to activate the list
#    of units before activating this unit.
# BindsTo: Similar to Requires, also stops this unit when the listed unit stops.
# Before: This unit must be started before the listed units. Does not imply
#    dependency.
# After: The list of units must be started before this unit. Does not imply
#    dependency.
# Conflicts: This unit can not be run at the same time with the listed unit. If 
#    this unit starts, other units stop.
# Condition: This unit starts if the conditions are met. If conditions are not met,
#    this unit is skipped.
# Assert: Similar to condition. But if conditions are not met, a failure is caused.
#
# 1.4.2. Install Section Directives (Applies to all unit types)
# WantedBy: Similar to Wants directive of the Unit section. Mostly used with 
#    targets.
# RequiredBy: Similar to WantedBy but is more strict. Causes a failure if the 
#    dependency is not met.
# Alias: Allows the unit have an alias name. (Like ssh, sshd).
# Also: Additional units to install/deinstall when this unit is installed/
#    deinstalled,
# DefaultInstance: Only used with template units. Default instance name of the
#    unit enabled from a template.
#
# 1.4.3. Service Section Directives (Applies to Service unit types)
# Type: Could be one of the following
#    simple: Systemd considers that the service starts immediately.
#    exec: Similar to simple, but systemd waits for binary to execute.
#    forking: The service forks a child process and exists.
#    oneshot: The service live for a short time and then exit.
#    dbus: The service will take a name on the D-Bus bus.
#    notify: The service will notify when finishes starting up.
#    idle: This indicates that the service will not be run until all jobs are 
#        dispatched.
# RemainAfterExit: Commonly used with the oneshot type. Indicates that the 
#    service isactive even after the process exits.
# PIDFile: For forking type, file to contain the PID of the child process.
# BusName: For dbus type, name to acquire as D-Bus name.
# NotifyAccess: Takes none, main, exec or none values. Controls which service 
#    status messages are notified. 
# ExecStart: Command to start the service. If starts with -, ignore failure.
# ExecStartPre: Additional commands to run before the main process. 
# ExecStartPost: Additional commands to run after the main process.
# ExecReload: Command to reload the service.
# ExecStop: Command to stop the service.
# ExecStopPost: Additional commands to run after stopping the process.
# RestartSec: Amount of time to wait before restart.
# Restart: Circumstances to automatically restart the service. Could be: always,
#    on-success, on-failure, on-abnormal, on-abort, on-watchdog etc.
# TimeoutSec: Amount of time to wait before starting or stopping the service 
#    before marking as failed (or killing it).
# TimeoutStartSec: Amount of time to wait before starting service before marking 
#    as failed (or killing it).
# TimeoutStopSec: Amount of time to wait before starting service before marking 
#    as failed (or killing it).
#
# 1.4.3. Socket Section Directives (Applies to Socket unit types)
# ListenStream: Address to listen on for a TCP stream.
# ListenDatagram: Address to listen on for a UDP stream.
# ListenSequentialPacket: Address to listen on for a Unix socket stream.
# ListenFIFO: File system FIFO to listen on.
# Accept: If yes, a service instance is spawned for each incoming connection, if 
#    no, all listening sockets are passed to the started service unit.
# SocketUser: Unix user name for the socket (default root).
# SocketGroup: Unix group name for the socket (default root).
# SocketMode: System access permissions for the socket (default 0666).
# Service: Connected service name (if different than the socket name).
#
# 1.4.4. Mount Section Directives (Applies to Mount unit types)
# What: Path to be mounted.
# Where: Path to mount.
# Type: The filesystem type of the mount.
# Options: A comma-separated list of the mount options.
# SloppyOptions: Boolean to determine whether the mount will fail if there is an 
#     unrecognized mount option.
# DirectoryMode: Permission mode for the parent dirs of the mount point.
# TimeoutSec: Amount of time to wait before the operation is marked as failed.
#
# 1.4.5. Automount Section Directives (Applies to Automount unit types)
# Where: Path to mount.
# DirectoryMode: Permission mode for the parent dirs of the mount point.
#
# 1.4.6. Swap Section Directives (Applies to Swap unit types)
# What: Path of the location of swap (file or device).
# Priority: Swap priority in integer form.
# Options: Comma separated list of options for /etc/fstab file.
# TimeoutSec: Amount of time to wait before the operation is marked as failed.
#
# 1.4.7. Path Section Directives (Applies to Path unit types)
# PathExists: If this path exists, associated unit will be activated.
# PathExistsGlob: Similar to PathExists, supports file glob expressions.
# PathChanged: Activates the associated unit when the file in the path is saved 
#    and closed.
# PathModified: Similar to PathChanged but also activates the unit when the file
#    is changed.
# DirectoryNotEmpty: Activates the associated unit when the specified directory
#    is not empty.
# Unit: Connected unit name (if different than the path name).
# MakeDirectory: If true, the directories to watch are created before watching
# DirectoryMode: Permissions to use if MakeDirectory is true (Default 755)
#
# 1.4.8. Timer Section Directives (Applies to Timer unit types)
# OnActiveSec: Activate the associated unit after this amount of time  after the 
#    activation time of the timer unit.
# OnBootSec: Activate the associated unit after this amount of the time after
#    the boot.
# OnStartupSec: Activate the associated unit after this amount of the time after
#    systemd process started.
# OnUnitActiveSec: Activate the associated unit after this amount of the time 
#    after the associated unit last activated.
# OnUnitInactiveSec: Activate the associated unit after this amount of the time 
#    after the associated unit last marked as inactive.
# OnCalendar: Absolute time to activate the associated unit.
# AccuracySec: Level of accuracy of the timer.
# Unit: Associated unit name (if different than the timer name).
# Persistent: If true, the time when the service unit was last triggered is stored
#    on disk. When the timer is activated, the service unit is triggered
#    immediately if it would have been triggered at least once during the time 
#    when the timer was inactive.

</a> <div id="Div7" style="margin-left:10%;"><pre><code># systemd has some other components too. Some of them:
#
# systemd-boot: UEFI boot manager. Supports basic boot manager configuration. 
#     Integrates with systemctl command. Has the command bootctl.
# systemd-localed: Manages system locale settings. Has the command localectl.
# systemd-logind: Manages user logins. Keeps track of users and sessions. Handles
#     device access management for users.
# systemd-machined: Detects and monitors virtual machines and containers. Has 
#     machinectl command.
# systemd-mount: Handles .mount and .automount units.
# systemd-networkd: Network configuration management. Configuration files are in
#     /lib/systemd/network, /run/systemd/network, and /etc/systemd/network in 
#     increasing precedence.
# systemd-nspawn: May be used to run a command or OS in a light-weight
#     namespace container. In many ways it is similar to chroot
# systemd-resolved: Provides network name resolution. Has resolvectl command.
# systemd-sysusers: Creates system users and groups.
# systemd-timesyncd: Provides system time synchronization across the network with
#     a remote NTP server. Has timedatectl command.
# systemd-tmpfiles: Creates, deletes, and cleans up volatile and temporary files
#     and directories.
# systemd-udevd: Manages physical devices.
