#---Specs
# - Adminer is a powerful web based management tool for Mysql, Mariadb and
# more. You have to install it on the server which has the DB installed.
# - On my config I wanted to bind Adminer to a specific site config on the 
# server side and restrict it with only 1 client IP (might be more) to
# reach.
#
# - My Hostname: adminer.x11.xyz
# Lamp is already installed (See LampOnUbuntu Tutorial)
# My Client IP address: 192.168.1.108
# MariaDB Admin User: dbadmin   Password: PaSswOrD1234
# - Server Versions: Debian 12/11 Ubuntu 22.04/20.04 LTS Server


#---1. Install Adminer
# - It is possible to download Adminer php files and use them, but I prefer
# installing its package, this way all the upgrades will be managed by
# Debian/Ubuntu.
sudo apt update
sudo apt install adminer --yes

#---2. DB Admin User
# - We are going to need a Database Admin user to log in Adminer and manage 
# the databases.
sudo mariadb
# - Run on Mariadb shell
grant all on *.* to 'dbadmin'@'localhost' identified by 'PaSswOrD1234';


#---3. Configure Web Site
#-- 3.1. Create a Web Site Config File and Fill it
sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/adminer.x11.xyz.conf
# If you have more than 1 IP to reach Adminer, add them to Require IP line
#   after the first IP.
# If you don't need IP control, remove all the directory stanza (lines 2,3,4)
#_________________________________________________________________________
<VirtualHost *:80>
    <Directory /usr/share/adminer/adminer>
       Require ip 192.168.1.108

#_________________________________________________________________________
#
# - Create a home directory for the site and set permissions
sudo mkdir /var/www/adminer
sudo chown www-data:www-data /var/www/adminer
sudo chmod 770 /var/www/adminer
# - If you want, you can put an index.html file to the home directory, but I 
# prefer leaving the home directory empty and access to Adminer through its
# directory.
#
#-- 3.2. Enable the Site and Reload Apache
sudo a2ensite adminer.x11.xyz.conf
sudo systemctl reload apache2


#---4. Run it
# - Your web based Database Management tool is ready:
http://adminer.x11.xyz/adminer
# - You need to select MySQL for MariaDB, server must be localhost 
# (default), username: dbadmin, password: (whatever you gave at the Mariadb 
# script, Database: leave empty to reach all the databases.


#---5. Security
# - You should enable https if you want to put your site on the internet. 
# Actually https should be enabled on local network sites too. Refer to 
# CertbotOnDebianUbuntu tutorial for enabling https with free certificates.
