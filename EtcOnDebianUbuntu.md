# /etc/ Folder on Debian and Ubuntu

## Specs
### Info
/etc directory is a crucial part of the filesystem hierarchy. It stands for "et cetera" and is used to store system-wide configuration files and directories. 

These configuration files control various aspects of the operating system, services, and installed applications (virtually everything) on Linux.

I tried to cover all the files and folders under /etc/ for efault install Debian 12 (without GUI) and Ubuntu 22.04 Server edition. I added some (IMHO) important packages too.

## /etc/.pwd.lock
---
File exists in default Ubuntu & Debian installations.

Used by the system to prevent multiple simultaneous changes to the system password database.

The lckpwdf() and ulckpwdf() functions enable modification access to the password databases through this lock file. 

A process first uses lckpwdf() to lock the lock file, thereby gaining exclusive rights to modify the /etc/passwd or /etc/shadow password database.

## /etc/adduser.conf
---
File exists in default Ubuntu & Debian installations.
Used to configure default settings for the adduser and addgroup commands which are used for creating new users and groups on the system.

#SKEL=/etc/skel
#
# Specify inclusive ranges of UIDs and GIDs from which UIDs and GIDs
# for system users, system groups, non-system users and non-system groups
# can be dynamically allocated.
# Default: FIRST_SYSTEM_UID=100, LAST_SYSTEM_UID=999
#FIRST_SYSTEM_UID=100
#LAST_SYSTEM_UID=999
#
# Default: FIRST_SYSTEM_GID=100, LAST_SYSTEM_GID=999

#UID_POOL=/etc/adduser-pool.conf
#UID_POOL=/etc/adduser-pool.d/
#GID_POOL=/etc/adduser-pool.conf
#GID_POOL=/etc/adduser-pool.d/
#
# Specify whether each created non-system user will be
# given their own group to use.
# Default: USERGROUPS=yes
#USERGROUPS=yes
#
# Defines the groupname or GID of the group all newly-created
# non-system users are placed into.
# It is a configuration error to define both variables
# even if the values are consistent.

## /etc/adjtime
---
File exist in default Debian installations.

File does not exist in default Ubuntu installations.

Used to store the hardware clock's (Real-Time Clock or RTC) time adjustment information.

The Hardware Clock is usually not very accurate. However, much of its inaccuracy is completely predictable - it gains or loses the same amount of time every day. This is called systematic drift.

Sample content:

```
0.000000 1692481832 0.000000
1692481832
UTC
```
 
Explanations:  

- First line: Three numbers, separated by blanks.
   -Drift factor: The systematic drift rate in seconds per day
   - Last adjust time: The resulting number of seconds since 1969 UTC of most recent adjustment or calibration.
   - Adjustment status: 0
- Second line : Last calibration time. The resulting number of seconds since 1969 UTC of most recent calibration. Zero if there has been no calibration yet.
- Third line: Clock mode: UTC or LOCAL.

Excerpt from /etc/cryptsetup-initramfs/conf-hook

```
# Configuration file for the cryptroot initramfs hook.

# KEYFILE_PATTERN: ...

# The value of this variable is interpreted as a shell pattern.
# Matching key files from the crypttab(5) are included in the initramfs
# image.  The associated devices can then be unlocked without manual
# intervention.  (For instance if /etc/crypttab lists two key files
# /etc/keys/{root,swap}.key, you can set KEYFILE_PATTERN="/etc/keys/*.key"
# to add them to the initrd.)

# If KEYFILE_PATTERN if null or unset (default) then no key file is
# copied to the initramfs image.

# Note that the glob(7) is not expanded for crypttab(5) entries with a
# 'keyscript=' option.  In that case, the field is not treated as a file
# name but given as argument to the keyscript.
#KEYFILE_PATTERN=

# ASKPASS: [ y | n ]

# Whether to include the askpass binary to the initramfs image.  askpass
# is required for interactive passphrase prompts, and ASKPASS=y (the
# default) is implied when the hook detects that same device needs to be
# unlocked interactively (i.e., not via keyfile nor keyscript) at
# initramfs stage.  Setting ASKPASS=n also skips `cryptroot-unlock`
# inclusion as it requires the askpass executable.

#ASKPASS=y
```

# /etc/libblockdevconf.d/00-default.cfg
# This is the default configuration for the libblockdev library. For
# each supported technology/plugin there is a separate section/group
# with the 'sonames' key. The value of the key has to be a list of
# sonames of shared objects that should be attempted to be loaded for
# the plugin falling back to the next one in the list.

# So this example:
# [lvm]
# sonames=libbd_lvm-dbus.so.0;libbd_lvm.so.0
#
# would result in the libbd_lvm-dbus.so.0 shared object attempted to
# be loaded and if that failed, the libbd_lvm.so.0 would be attempted
# to be loaded.

```
# REQUIRED for useradd/userdel/usermod
#   Directory where mailboxes reside, _or_ name of file, relative to the
#   home directory.  If you _do_ define MAIL_DIR and MAIL_FILE,
#   MAIL_DIR takes precedence.

#   Essentially:
#      - MAIL_DIR defines the location of users mail spool files
#        (for mbox use) by appending the username to MAIL_DIR as defined
#        below.
#      - MAIL_FILE defines the location of the users mail spool files as the
#        fully-qualified filename obtained by prepending the user home
#        directory before $MAIL_FILE
#
# NOTE: This is no more used for setting up users MAIL environment variable
#       which is, starting from shadow 4.0.12-1 in Debian, entirely the
#       job of the pam_mail PAM modules
#       See default PAM configuration files provided for
#       login, su, etc.

# This is a temporary situation: setting these variables will soon
# move to /etc/default/useradd and the variables will then be
# no more supported
MAIL_DIR        /var/mail
#MAIL_FILE      .mail
#
# Enable logging of successful logins
#
LOG_OK_LOGINS		no
#
# Enable "syslog" logging of su activity - in addition to sulog file logging.
# SYSLOG_SG_ENAB does the same for newgrp and sg.

SYSLOG_SU_ENAB		yes
SYSLOG_SG_ENAB		yes
#
# If defined, all su activity is logged to this file.
#
#SULOG_FILE	/var/log/sulog
#
# If defined, file which maps tty line to TERM environment parameter.
# Each line of the file is in a format something like "vt100  tty01".
#
#TTYTYPE_FILE	/etc/ttytype
#
# If defined, login failures will be logged here in a utmp format
# last, when invoked as lastb, will read /var/log/btmp, so...

[DEFAULT]
# how to byte-compile (comma separated: standard, optimize)
byte-compile = standard
```

```
# /etc/python3.11/sitecustomize.py
# install the apport exception handler if available
try:
    import apport_python_hook
except ImportError:
    pass
else:
    apport_python_hook.install()
```

<br>

## /etc/rc*.d/ Folders
---

Excerpt from content:

```
# Example configuration file for reportbug(1)
# Options can be specified in any order
# usually, no-OPTION will disable OPTION if OPTION is boolean

# Default severity level; will bypass prompt in reportbug, so disabled
# severity normal

# BTS to use
# See 'reportbug --bts help' for a current list of supported BTSes
# bts debian

# Submission address: default is 'submit'
# Can also be 'quiet' or 'maintonly'; see --report-quiet and --maintonly
# entries on man page
submit

# Mailer to use (default is empty, to use internal mailer). One of:
# mutt
# mh
# nmh

# You can also use 'mua'; it takes an argument like that to --mua
# mua 'mutt'
#
# Additional headers to add:
# header "X-Silly-Header: I haven't edited my /etc/reportbug.conf"
# header "X-Debbugs-No-Ack: please" # to suppress acknowledgments

# The following boolean options can be disabled by adding 'no-'
# Should I query the BTS?
query-bts
#
# Should I check for newer releases of the package
# check-available
#
# Should I CC the reporter?
cc
#
# Should I ever include modified config files?

DNS resolvers are responsible for translating domain names (e.g., www.example.com) into IP addresses that computers can use to communicate over a network.

In Ubuntu it is a symbolic link to /run/systemd/resolve/stub-resolv.conf. 

That is because Ubuntu uses systemd-networkd and systemd-resolvd.

Sample content:
```
# Nameservers
nameserver 192.168.1.1
nameserver 8.8.8.8
nameserver 8.8.4.4
#
# Search domain
search example.com
```

# /etc/ssh/ssh_config
# This is the ssh client system-wide configuration file.  See
# ssh_config(5) for more information.  This file provides defaults for
# users, and the values can be changed in per-user configuration files
# or on the command line.

# Configuration data is parsed as follows:
#  1. command line options
#  2. user-specific file
#  3. system-wide file
# Any configuration value is only changed the first time it is set.
# Thus, host-specific definitions should be at the beginning of the
# configuration file, and defaults at the end.

# Site-wide defaults for some commonly used options.  For a comprehensive
# list of available options, their meanings and defaults, please see the
# ssh_config(5) man page.
