#Ubuntu Tutorials

I am a learner of Ubuntu. These are the tutorials I prepared with the help of internet sources and books. I credited the sources that helped me on each document.

AGT-ADOnUbuntu: Establishing an Active Directory environment using Ubuntu Servers. A primary DC, a secondary DC and a file server configured. Windows workstations can join the domain.

AGT-ApacheOnUbuntu: Installing and configuring Apache 2 on Ubuntu server. With sample configuration and SSL support.

AGT-CertbotOnUbuntu: Using certbot tool of eff.org to automatize obtaining and renewing letsencrytp.org SSL certificates on Apache 2 and Ubuntu Server.

AGT-ISPMailTutorialLokum: A document to prepare multi domain mail server with all the necessary tools. This document is a very minor modification of Alexey Abel's ISP Mail Tutorial (Caramel Edition) at https://123qwe.com/. Also, Alexey's document is (not so minor) modification of ISPmail tutorials of Christop Haas at https://workaround.org/ispmail.

AGT-LampOnUbuntu: Installation of Lamp stack on Ubuntu server. My choice is DB is Mariadb.

AGT-MariadbOnUbuntu: Mariadb installation and basic configuration on Ubuntu. Includes some user management and master-slave replication.
