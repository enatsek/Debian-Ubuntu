# Debian & Ubuntu Tutorials & Guides

A collection of practical documentation for Debian and Ubuntu system administration. These guides are written from real-world experience and serve as a reference for common tasks, configurations, and troubleshooting.

## About This Repository

This documentation started as personal notes to compensate for a terrible memory. What began as a single text file evolved into a comprehensive collection of tutorials covering web servers, databases, networking, virtualization, and system administration.

**Philosophy:** Keep it simple, text-based, and useful. Every guide here documents something I've actually configured or deployed.
