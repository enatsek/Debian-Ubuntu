#Debian and Ubuntu Tutorials

I am a learner of Debian and Ubuntu. These are the tutorials I prepared with the help of internet sources and books. I credited the sources that helped me on each document.

My Linux voyage started with Ubuntu. I still use Ubuntu as desktop, but for the server part, I'm moving towards Debian. I am still in between, so I use both of them. 

There are txt and html versions of each document. In the html version, commands and codes are in colors for easy navigation.
