# About

I am a Linux (mainly Debian and Ubuntu) and Python (3 preferred) enthusiast. You can call me Exforge, my long name is exforge@x386.org

I am learning Debian and Ubuntu Linux and Python 3 all myself, with the help of internet sources and books. I try to share all that I learn here and at github: <https://github.com/enatsek/>.

Please consider that all these documents are prepared for self reference, and they are a bit informal. Iâ€™ll be glad if they can help anyone around the world.

If you cannot bother yourself to read Licence and Privacy Policy pages, here is a very brief version of them: You can freely use documents on this site and we do not keep any of your personal data, never.
