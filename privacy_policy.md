# Privacy Policy


## Who we are

Our website address is: https://x386.org. We are a single individual.

## What personal data we collect and why we collect it

Shortly, we do not collect any data from you, nada.

We do not keep comments, there is no contact form, you can only contact me with email. We do not keep cookies or logs, not even error logs. We respect privacy. So, **we do not keep your private data**.

## Who we share your data with

As we do not keep your data, there is no way for us to share your data. So **we do not share your data with anyone else, because we do not have your data**. I have to admit I wouldn’t share your data with anyone else even if I had it.
